## 📂 PORTFOLIO PROJECTS

### 1. [ DNS Connectivity Troubleshooting](https://github.com/EgereDavid/DNS-Connectivity-Log)
**Scenario:** A client couldn't access the internet despite being connected to Wi-Fi.
**Action:** Diagnosed a "soft" failure using `ping` and `nslookup`. Traced the root cause to a static, invalid DNS entry (`10.0.0.0`).
**Result:** Restored connectivity by configuring Cloudflare Public DNS and flushing the cache.

### 2. [ Windows Security Audit & Forensics](https://github.com/EgereDavid/Windows-Security-Audit-)
**Scenario:** Client suspected persistent malware mechanisms on a workstation.
**Action:** Conducted a forensic audit using Sysinternals Autoruns and VirusTotal API. Identified and disabled high-risk unsigned drivers while avoiding false positives in the Registry (WoW64).
**Result:** Achieved 0 active intrusions and maintained 100% system stability.

### 3. [ Windows Kernel BSOD Analysis](https://github.com/EgereDavid/Windows-Kernel-BSOD-Analysis)
**Scenario:** Production workstation suffered random crashes (`IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL`).
**Action:** Analyzed memory dump files (`.dmp`) using BlueScreenView. Traced the kernel panic to missing Intel Thermal Framework drivers.
**Result:** Eliminated crashes by deploying OEM-specific chipset drivers.

### 4. [ Malware Remediation & ACL Management](https://github.com/EgereDavid/-Malware-and-Remediation-)
**Scenario:** A compromised USB installer dropped a persistent Trojan into `System32` protected by TrustedInstaller.
**Action:** Identified the unsigned payload and used CLI commands (`takeown`, `icacls`) to escalate privileges and override system file protections.
**Result:** Successfully eradicated the malware without requiring a system re-image.
